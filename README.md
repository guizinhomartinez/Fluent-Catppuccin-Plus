# Fluent Catppuccin Plus •⩊•
*A Discord theme dedicated to uniformity, featuring the delightful Catppuccin theme as its primary color scheme.*  
*The name has 0 meaning I just thought it sounded cool.*
# About
 The theme is all about making discord more consistency, since the default theme is very inconsistent, ugly and boring. It's just a little project of mine so don't expect consistent updates or anything really serious here.
# Warnings
⚠️ I do not recommend using this code in any way if you're thinking of making your own theme, since this code is really messy and amateur. ⚠️  
⚠️ Currently WIP, expect things to be broken or missing. ⚠️

# Plans for the future
- [ ] Add GIFs showcasing the theme  
- [ ] Finish white theme
